         	<blockquote>
<p>But we might ask ourselves the same question about the story of our faith. A story of lives called, hardships suffered, and death certain. To a point, Christianity is a story of abject failure. Of Jobs and Judases, of Passions and prisons. If to unbelievers it is a fairy tale, then it is a very dark fairy tale. And yet we know that all of this suffering isn‚Äôt for naught. What seems a story of loss is in fact the most brilliant, if not stealthy, triumph. Enveloped in pain and suffering, the Christian narrative sneaks in tender mercies and unexpected miracles, loving acts and timeless wisdom. And it is all capped off with an unfathomable Resurrection. There is grace that ultimately and completely washes away the devastation of man. There is a faith that understands the larger story.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I never thought of it that way. But he‚Äôs right, what a story it is.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The man who had forgotten who he was is reminded of the dignity he had forgotten. This is why I teach King Lear. And why I love it. This is what I want my medical students and residents to understand. That though we are broken and complex, our dignity (and the dignity of our patients) is independent of status, power, or possessions. And sometimes, in this world of tragedy‚Äîa world that sometimes just doesn‚Äôt give a damn about you or me‚Äîwe need to be reminded and to remind others of the dignity that we have forgotten. The dignity of being a child of God.</p>

<p>The essence of this approach is for any task that you find you are procrastinating on, pick a small part (step) of the task to start on. The key thing is to pick a step that is so small and so simple that you cannot fail at it.</p>

         	<p>Ran into an issue where I could not open  rptproj files with Visual Studio 2019. Since these were old SSRS reports, I thought I&rsquo;d try opening them with Visual Studio 2013. Didn&rsquo;t work either. Visual Studio 2012? Nope.</p>

<p>Did some more research and eventually found out that this is not a Visual Studio issue. Apparently, to open rptproj files with Visual Studio, you need to install the corresponding Microsoft SQL Server Data Tools - Business Intelligence package. Would not have figured that out had it not been for this <a href="https://www.spiria.com/en/blog/web-applications/visual-studio-does-not-recognize-rptproj-files/#:~:text=%27YourProject.rptproj%27%20cannot%20be%20opened%20because%20its%20project%20type,a%20version%20that%20supports%20this%20type%20of%20project.">post</a>.</p>

<p>So I went <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/download/details.aspx?id=36843">here</a> to download the SQL Server Data Tools BI package. Installed it. And now I can open the SSRS solution/project in Visual Studio 2012.</p>

<p>Walking is increasingly mediated by technological gadgets worn on wrists or gripped in hands. We spend an increasing amount of time ‚Äòscreening‚Äô the world ‚Äì taking in most of life through a contracted frame that captures objects of immediate interest. To live with eyes on the screen is to be attached, stuck in the frame, taking in what is presented to us and re-presented to us again. But representation ‚Äì even in fine-grained pixilation ‚Äì is not experience. To experience is to perceive. When we look at a screen, we might see something, but we don‚Äôt perceive. To live life through representations is to live passively, to receive rather than to experience.</p>

         	<p>I&rsquo;ve ran into a number of articles these past few days talking about software design principles and design patterns. I ran into one that talked about how we should <a href="http://qualityisspeed.blogspot.com/2014/09/beyond-solid-dependency-elimination.html">move beyond SOLID design principles</a>. I&rsquo;m also reading another talking about <a href="https://ardalis.com/postels-law-robustness-principle/">Postel&rsquo;s Law</a> and its downsides. What I&rsquo;ve learned from reading these articles, is that the most important skill software developers need with regards to software design principles and design patterns, is to know when to use them. Each design principle/pattern can come with some downsides, so it is best to be able to determine whether you need to implement them in the first place.</p>

        <div class="e-content">
         	<p>I&rsquo;ve been looking for a way to add comments to this blog. It&rsquo;s specifically for my friends who don&rsquo;t have a Micro.blog account. I saw someone mention Hyvor Talk back when I just joined Micro.blog. I thought I&rsquo;d give it a try. It turns out to be relatively easy to install. You&rsquo;ll need to be using a <a href="https://help.micro.blog/2019/about-themes/">custom theme</a> to do this. I used the <a href="https://help.micro.blog/2019/disqus/">instructions to add Disqus comments</a> as reference.</p>

<p>First step is to add canonical tags to the blog. I modified <strong><code>layouts/partials/head.html</code></strong> and added a canonical tag just above the css link tags. I tried to copy the code itself here, but I keep running into issues with Hugo not wanting to show it. So, you&rsquo;ll get a picture instead.<br />
<img src="uploads/2020/c0555eed08.png" width="231" height="173" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next step is to sign-up for <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/">Hyvor Talk</a>. Choose &ldquo;Manual Installation&rdquo;. Copy the code/script that they provide and paste it inside <strong><code>layouts/post/single.html</code></strong> just before the last <strong><code>&#123;&#123; end }}</code></strong> at the bottom of the file.</p>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it.</p>

<p>And although TV and video games of course offer escapism, there‚Äôs nothing quite like devouring the pages of a beautiful novel, sitting quietly in one place while letting words transport you to another.

<p>Hmmm I&rsquo;d put books and videogames on the same level. It&rsquo;s also very much dependent on how good a book and videogame is. While a good book can allow your mind to wander into a wonderful world full of possibilities, at the end of the day, you&rsquo;re still following the story. A really good videogame on the other hand, gives you a world to play in and let&rsquo;s you write your own story.</p>

<p>Smoothing the way through ‚Äòlawnmower parenting‚Äô serves to make your children ready for smooth roads only. Constant hovering around your children only makes them even more reliant on your presence. As the person who loves them most, don‚Äôt ask yourself what you can do to help your children every day, but what you can do to help them help themselves. That‚Äôs a parenting action that will truly prepare them for the bumps, twists and turns of the life journeys stretching ahead of them.<br />

<p>When you prioritise your children‚Äôs rights over their responsibilities, you prevent them from learning the skill of accountability and from experiencing the wellbeing benefits of contributing to society.

         	<p>I was running a test and kept running into the error below. I would not allow myself to check-in my code unless my tests passed. Battled with this fates-cursed error for over an hour. I double-checked my test project app.config file and the relevant client.config files - everything looked right.</p>

<p>It turns out, there was a typo in the Web.config file for another service. See, the service method that I&rsquo;m trying to test, was running inside another service. So, in addition to the test project&rsquo;s app.config file, I also needed to double-check the other service&rsquo;s Web.config file. And that other Web.config file had a fates-cursed typo on it&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>Switch out the Disqus comments system on my dev blog for <a href="https://utteranc.es/">utterances</a>. Since it is a dev blog, I figure most of the people who visit would most likely have Github accounts.</li>
<li>Try to install <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/">Hyvor Talk</a> on this micro.blog hosted blog.

         	<p>Found another use for this micro.blog/micro journal of mine. I can use it to quickly store ideas for posts to write on my dev blog. Later on, I can come back here, find the post I wrote, flesh it out and post it on my dev blog. A possible benefit to would-be readers is that, even in its most basic form, it might already have enough info to help other people.</p>

<p>Normally, I would write these things down on my bullet journal. But I have noticed that I never seem to turn those notes into blog posts. Part of the problem is that it takes awhile for me to write down a solution to a technical problem. So, when writing things down, I sort of skimp on the details. When I come back to my notes, days, weeks, months later, I don&rsquo;t have enough info to turn it into a blog post. I&rsquo;m hoping this practice would help me get more content up on my dev blog.</p>

         	<p>üèÄ Okay first, the good news. The good news is that the Dallas Mavericks have clinched a playoff spot. <em>Thanks to the Spurs for defeating the Grizzlies tonight.</em> The Mavs have not been in the playoffs since 2016.</p>

<p>Now the bad news. The bad news is that the Mavs are on a 2-game losing streak since the restart of the NBA season. They could have won both games, but gave up the lead and lost at the end. They cannot close games. And their defense is so inconsistent. At this rate, if they don‚Äôt improve on those aspects of their game, I dont see them getting past the first round of the playoffs.</p>

<p>Brandon Ingram&rsquo;s last second 3 point shot was in&hellip; before it rolled out. To be fair to the Jazz, they fought back to  win the game. And Lebron, well Lebron is still Lebron. The long break from the game and his age did nothing to slow him down. Picked up his own miss to put the Lakers ahead at the end of the game.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m looking forward to the Mavericks vs Rockets game later tonight. Let&rsquo;s go Mavs!</p>
