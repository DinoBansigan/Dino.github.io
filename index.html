         	<blockquote>
<p>One of the most insistently repeated themes of the Bible is that, since we are made according to God’s image, we will not find fulfillment in anything other than God, or in any simulacrum of divinity. And this insight is repeated by practically every major figure in our tradition, most famously and poetically by Augustine:“Our hearts are restless till they rest in Thee.”<br />
~ Bishop Barron</p>

         	<p>The Mavs were right there, but just couldn’t stop the Clippers at the end. I can’t help but feel that KP’s ejection tilted the game in the Clippers’ favor. Oh well, lesson learned for this young Mavs team. They will get better. 🏀</p>

<p>It turns out, there was a typo in the Web.config file for another service. See, the service method that I&rsquo;m trying to test, was running inside another service. So, in addition to the test project&rsquo;s app.config file, I also needed to double-check the other service&rsquo;s Web.config file. And that other Web.config file had a fates-cursed typo on it&hellip;</p>

         	<p>The Mavs come from behind 7 points in the 4th to force the game into overtime. Then Luka shows why he’s special and helps the Mavs beat the Bucks in overtime. Much needed win for the Mavs against an elite team. His <a href="https://www.espn.com/nba/video?gameId=401224759">between the legs pass to Kleber</a> was amazing. 🏀</p>

         	<p>Tuned in to the Mavs vs Bucks game. Second quarter, Mavs ahead 54-50. Awesome. Went to the kitchen to do some stuff. When i looked back on the TV, Coach Carlisle was getting a T, Luka also got a T and all of a sudden the Bucks were ahead 64-56. What the heck. 🏀🤦🏻‍♂️🤷🏻‍♂️</p>

         	<p>Found another use for this micro.blog/micro journal of mine. I can use it to quickly store ideas for posts to write on my dev blog. Later on, I can come back here, find the post I wrote, flesh it out and post it on my dev blog. A possible benefit to would-be readers is that, even in its most basic form, it might already have enough info to help other people.</p>

<p>Normally, I would write these things down on my bullet journal. But I have noticed that I never seem to turn those notes into blog posts. Part of the problem is that it takes awhile for me to write down a solution to a technical problem. So, when writing things down, I sort of skimp on the details. When I come back to my notes, days, weeks, months later, I don&rsquo;t have enough info to turn it into a blog post. I&rsquo;m hoping this practice would help me get more content up on my dev blog.</p>

         	<p>Was going to try and welcome new bloggers whenever I see them pop-up on the other blogging platform I am on - something that I see happen often here on micro.blog. I went from trying to figure out how to respond to someone&rsquo;s untitled post, to trying to figure out what to title my own post, to feeling like I am trying to advertise myself by doing so, to just closing the window. Without a dedicated Reply button, it&rsquo;s just not the same.</p>

<p>Now the bad news. The bad news is that the Mavs are on a 2-game losing streak since the restart of the NBA season. They could have won both games, but gave up the lead and lost at the end. They cannot close games. And their defense is so inconsistent. At this rate, if they don’t improve on those aspects of their game, I dont see them getting past the first round of the playoffs.</p>

         	<p>Restart of the NBA season 🏀 could not have gone any better. The first two games back from the break went down to the wire. Both games ended with teams within 2 points of each other.</p>

<p>Brandon Ingram&rsquo;s last second 3 point shot was in&hellip; before it rolled out. To be fair to the Jazz, they fought back to  win the game. And Lebron, well Lebron is still Lebron. The long break from the game and his age did nothing to slow him down. Picked up his own miss to put the Lakers ahead at the end of the game.</p>

<p>Now I&rsquo;m looking forward to the Mavericks vs Rockets game later tonight. Let&rsquo;s go Mavs!</p>

         	<p>Yesterday, Davin was running on the hallway, tripped over something and fell. My brother asked him if he was okay. Davin replied, <em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m better than okay, JJ.&rdquo;</em></p>

<p>Where is he picking up all these lines from? 😄</p>

         	<p>After taking a shower and getting ready, my 4 year old said: <em>&ldquo;Dad, you forgot to comb your hair.&rdquo;</em> And I replied, <em>&ldquo;Davin, I don&rsquo;t need to comb my hair because I have a buzzcut.&rdquo;</em> 😀</p>

<p>Kids are so innocent and adorable at this age. It will be a sad day when they grow up past that.</p>

         	<p>One more day before the restart of the NBA season 🏀. Lakers vs Clippers tomorrow &ndash; should be an interesting game. Then Rockets vs Mavericks on Friday &ndash; a good chance to see if the Mavericks have improved during the break.</p>

<p>With the recent news of the coronavirus outbreak in baseball ⚾️, I can&rsquo;t help but think that maybe, just maybe, the NBA got it right. Keeping everyone inside the NBA bubble in Florida to me is a great idea. The risk of getting infected is very low as long as no one sick is allowed in. Everyone inside can stay safe and focus on their game.</p>
